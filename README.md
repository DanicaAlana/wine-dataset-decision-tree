# **DSF 35.0 Data Science Portfolio - Wine Classification Using Decision Tree**

## **Description**

This project is created for Digital Skill Fair (DSF) 35.0 - Data Science by Dibimbing. I am using Wine Recognition Dataset from scikit-learn, which is the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy by three different cultivators. There are thirteen different measurements taken for different constituents found in the three types of wine. You can access the dataset through this link: https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html#wine-recognition-dataset.

**Goals:**
1. Exploring the Wine dataset to understand the structure and basic information.
2. Building a prediction model using the Decision Tree Classifier algorithm.
3. Evaluating model performance based on predictions against test data.
4. Visualizing analysis results to understand data patterns or model performance.
